Drafting README content for Automated Patch Management System
I need to create a README file for a GitHub repository that describes the Automated Patch Management System project. The user wants just the text information about the project, not the actual code.
I'll structure the README with the following sections:
Project Title
Brief Description
Features
Folder Structure
Requirements
Installation
Usage
Scheduling
License
I'll base the content on the information the user has provided about the project, which includes PowerShell scripts for inventory collection, patch installation, and report generation, along with instructions for scheduling these scripts as tasks.
Let me draft the README content:
